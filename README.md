# High-Precision model for acoustic backscattering by liquid and gas filled prolate spheroid over a wide frequency range and tilt angles

Accompanging code to the manuscript "High-Precision model for acoustic backscattering by liquid and gas filled prolate spheroid over a wide frequency range and tilt angles â€“ Implications in fisheries acoustics" (Khodabandeloo et al.) 
submitted to Journal of Sound and Vibration for review.

# How to run the script to model the backscattering from a liquid- or gas-filled prolate spheroid. 

## 1 - Set the parameters of prolate spheroid and water in the src/settings.py

## 2 - Run one of the scripts src/script_liquid_filled.py or src/script_air_filled.py which are set up to use the liquid- and  gas-filled settings respectively. The result is the TS as a function of frequency which saves the csv file in the temp folder.

## Optional - Define your own settings in src/script_user_defined.py, and run
